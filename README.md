###About:

All ink enthusiast know that the only thing better than ink is fresh ink.  We're constantly looking for new inspiration for our body art.  **InkedGal** provides a way for ink lovers to storyboard their tattoo ideas.     

When Googling tattoo images or finding inspiration on Pinterest, there's no direct connect to the tattoo artist.  **InkedGal**  is designed so that users have a link to tattoo artists through Instagram even if they don't have an Instagram account.  By simply clicking on the image, a user can post that image to their INKspiration page.
